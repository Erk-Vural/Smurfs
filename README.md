# Smurfs Maze Game

Smurfs Maze Game is a 2D maze game developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game features a maze environment where players control a character navigating through the maze to reach the goal. Dijkstra's algorithm is utilized to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generate random maze layouts for each game session.
- **Character Control**: Control a character (e.g., a Smurf) to navigate through the maze.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provide a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Installation

   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

1. Launch the game.
2. Use keyboard controls to move the character through the maze.
3. Navigate through the maze, avoiding obstacles, to reach the goal.
4. Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal if desired.
